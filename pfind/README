=======
PURPOSE
=======
This is a utility that recursively descends a given directory tree, evaluating each file in the tree with a given expression(s) (passed as commandline arguments).


=========
INTERFACE
=========

The user interface to the program is the command line. Command
line syntax is as follows:

	pfind [path] [-name <expression>] [-type {f|d|b|c|p|l|s}] 

	path	This is the root of the directory tree to be traversed. 
	-name	printout files or directories that match the following expression.
	-type	printout files that match the given file type.



==============
DATA STRUCTURE
==============

An array is used in storing the search results from the traversal. 
A benefit to using this data structure is that an array of strings can easily be sorted using the qsort c library function as opposed to a linkedlist of strings.

The problem with using an array data structure is that I am already allocating that much memory at the onset of the program; memory which may never be completely used. 
To minimize such overhead of iterating through the entire array when printing the search results, the iteration of the found_results buffer stops at the current_index (which is the index of the last non-null entry in the array).

In terms of memory usage, a better approach would have been to use a linked list. With the head pointing to the last element added to the linked list, a pointer to the linkedlist head can be put on the stack with every recursive call. Just like using the array, the find results from traversing a directory/subdirectory would simply be appended to the original linkedlist structure. The advantage to this is that memory is only allocated as needed (i.e for each search).

Another problem in using an array data structure is that they are initialized with a fixed size. This causes a potential for buffer overflow (i.e where my search results exceed the size of my found_results buffer). To handle such cases, I have implemented a sort of 'bounds checking' to ensure that the current index never exceeds the buffer capacity. However, if this happens, I then increase the size of my buffer, by replacing it with a larger one before inserting the newly found result. 


=========
ALGORITHM
=========

Depending on the command line arguments parsed, parse_dir() function sets the criteria flag accordingly.

searcedir function sets the necessary variables and then kicks of the funtion which actually does the directory traversal - parsedir. Depending on the depth of the directory's file tree, the parsedir function makes recursive call(s) to itself, populating the same find_results buffer. 

On each recursive call, a pointer to the find_results buffer and the current index position is put on the stack. 

The flow below describes in detail how the program traverses the file tree.  

=============
PROGRAM FLOW
=============
searchdir: 
	- Initializes the search results buffer. 
	- Sets the criteria flag based on the commandline arguments
	- If the root file/directory meets the criteria first add it to the results buffer.
	- Puts the root file/directory path, a pointer to the results buffer and a pointer to its current index, as well as the search criteria and flag on the stack; and kicks off the tree traversal by calling parsedir function.  
	- When parsedir completes, the finalize_results function is called which outputs the content of the search results buffer
	- return 

parsedir:
	- Attempts to open the given directory or path.
	- If this fails, writes to the standard error stream saying the reason (using errno's value).
	- Else if opening path/directory is successful, clears errno and performs the following;
	- Continues to read every entry in the directory into a dirent struct.
	- For each dirent struct (or entry read) in the directory, the following steps are performed;
		> If the entry is a "." or ".." ignore it and read next dir entry.
		> Else, allocate memmory for a new string and put a properly formatted path of the dir entry currently been parsed.
		> The properly formatted path string of a dirent is a concatenation of its parent path (passed in the function argument) and its d_name property 
		> Next, check if the entry meets the search criteria.
		> If it meets the criteria, add the newly created string (dirent path) to the results buffer and increment the buffer's current index. 
		> If the entry added is a directory itself, then call the parsedir function, passing the newly created string as the starting directory. 
	- close the opened path/directory.
	- return

add_item:
	- Determines the size of the given buffer.
	- If the given current index exceeds the buffer size, reallocate a bigger memory for the current buffer (preserving its contents). 
	- Adds the given item to buffer at the given index position.
	- return

finalize_results:
	- Sorts the modified search results buffer.
	- Iterates through the buffer up until the current index.
	- On each iteration, after printing the string, it releases the allocated memory. 
	- return

=======
PART 1
=======

Task: Name and description of 3 unix programs that operate on directory trees; name of the program, a sample command line, and a one sentence description of what the program does.

A) chown
A sample usage: chown -R <user>:group <file/directory>. For example, 
			$ chown -R oracle:dba oracle11gr2. 

Description: This program changes the file owner and group of a file/direftory, and using the -R is able to apply this change recursively on subdirectories of the specified folder.   



B) chgrp
A sample usage: chgrp -R <groupname> <file/dir>. For example, 
			$ chgrp -R everyone test_folder 

Description: This program changes the group of a given file; it is also able to do this recursively on a given directory (i.e on all subdirectories as well).



C) Grep
A sample Usage: grep -R <regular_expression> <dir> 
			$ grep -R expression[0-9] .
Description: This program searches a given file/files for lines that match one or more specified patterns; using the -R option, the program is also able to search recursively for line patterns of all files under a directory tree.  


======
PART 3
======

Task: A method that will allow the pfind program to process directory trees that are deeper than the maximum number of open ﬁles.

This is my current alogirithm for traversing (recursively) the directory tree. It does not cater for such limitations.

	A) Attempts to open the given directory or path.
	B) If this fails, writes to the standard error stream saying the reason (using errno's value).
	C) Else if opening path/directory is successful, clears errno and performs the following;
	D) Continues to read every entry in the directory into a dirent struct.
	E) For each dirent struct (or entry read) in the directory, the following steps are performed;
		i. If the entry is a "." or ".." ignore it and read next dir entry.
		ii. Else, allocate memmory for a new string and put a properly formatted path of the dir entry currently been parsed.
		iii. The properly formatted path string of a dirent is a concatenation of its parent path (passed in the function argument) and its d_name property 
		iv. Next, check if the entry meets the search criteria.
		v. If it meets the criteria, add the newly created string (dirent path) to the results buffer and increment the buffer's current index. 
		vi. If the entry added is a directory itself, then call the parsedir function, passing the newly created string as the starting directory. 
	F) close the opened path/directory.
	G) return

This is the modification I would make in order to support the system open file limit. 

In step E(vi) above, instead of calling the recursive function before closing the current directory in step F, I would simply store the path to every subdirectoy in a local buffer. After looping through the entries and closing the currently opened path/directory in step F, then I iterate through my local buffer of subdirectoy paths, calling the recursive function on each subdirectory.
Rewriting steps E and F of the algorithm:

	E) For each dirent struct (or entry read) in the directory, the following steps are performed;
		i. If the entry is a "." or ".." ignore it and read next dir entry.
		
		ii. Else, allocate memmory for a new string and put a properly formatted path of the dir entry currently been parsed.
		
		iii. The properly formatted path string of a dirent is a concatenation of its parent path (passed in the function argument) and its d_name property 
		
		iv. Next, check if the entry meets the search criteria; If it does not meet the criteria continue the loop onto the next entry.
		
		v. If the entry is a sub directory itself, store its path (the newly created string) in a the local buffer. Do not process if yet.  
		
		vi. Else, add the newly created string (dirent path) to the results buffer and increment the buffer's current index. 
		
	F) close the opened path/directory.

	G) iterate through the local buffer of sub directories, calling this function on each item.
