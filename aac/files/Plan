Project: aac

Purpose: A program to display the total connect time of a user. 

Outline:
	aac reads and processes the wtmp file records and 
        determines how long a user has been logged in on various terminals.  
        aac uses read to get data from the file, and uses
        printf to format and output results.

Output:
	The output looks like:
           total  10.6

Arguments:
	aac accepts the following command line arguments;
		% aac *username*
         	% aac -f *filename* *username*
         	% aac *username* -f *filename*
        If no filename is given, aac uses WTMPX_FILE as defined
        in utmpx.h

Input:
        aac does not accept any user input; the datafile and the systems wtmpx files are the only source of input

Data Structures:
        aac uses the utmpx struct as described in utmpx.h 
	aac also has linked list struct which it uses in storing login records

Files:
	aac.c
	Makefile
	results
	Plan
