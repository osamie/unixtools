Project: aac

Purpose: A program that computes the total login time for a user specified on the command line

Outline:
	aac reads and processes the wtmpx file records and determines
	how long a user has been logged in on various terminals.  
	For each terminal logged into, aac stores the entries in a
	linked list of utmpx structs.
	
	This list is then parsed, and derives the corresponding login
	entries from the wtmpx file. The total time connect time for 
	a user is the sum of the differences between the logout time 
	and the login time for each login-logout pair.
  
        aac uses printf to format and output results.

Output:
	The output looks like:
           total  10.6
	where 10.6 or a decimal number represents the computed time

Arguments:
	acc accepts 2 arguments: username and filename.
	 When no filename is specified, WTMPX_FILE,
	 as defined in the system's utmpx.h, is used.
	
	 A filename is specified using the -f flag. For example, 
		$ aac *username* -f *filename*
			OR
		$ aac -f *filename* *username* 

Input:
        aac does not accept any user input; the datafile and the systems wtmpx files are the only source of input

Data Structures:
        aac uses the utmpx struct as described in utmpx.h 
	aac also has linked list struct which it uses in storing login records

Files:
	aac.c
	Makefile
	results
	Plan
