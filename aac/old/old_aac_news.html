	The version of ac on nice does not check for time changes.
	Read the manual page on wtmpfix to see how the
	time changes are handled on ice.

<dt><b>Special Cases</b></dt>

	<p>
	The following sections explain how ac (on ice) handles
	various special cases.  The gnu version of ac supports
	these ways of doing things as well as other ways.
	For more information, login to nice.harvard.edu and
	read the manual page on ac.

<dt><b>Mystery Logins: Missing logouts</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>
	Many people have wondered about people logging into ttys without
	a logout before it.  For example:<pre>
	sdas     ttys ttys6          8834    7 USER_PROCESS      949441628 
	bfriedm  ttys ttys6          8834    7 USER_PROCESS      949441637 
	</pre>
	shows that bfriedm logs in to ttys6 after sdas, but that sdas does
	not appear to logout.  How does that work?  It turns out you can
	type  <tt>login smith</tt> from a login session and start a new
	login session for a different user.  No DEAD_PROCESS record appears
	in wtmp because you never logout.  A new USER_PROCESS record appears
	because you have logged in.
	<p>
	</dd>
<dt><b>Multiple Logins: Same User</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>
	Many people have wondered about the multiple login
	entries in sample.wtmp for some people.
	For example, consider:
	<p>
	<pre>
	xliu     ttyq ttyq7         32714    7 USER_PROCESS      949441760
	zchen    ttys ttys6         23234    7 USER_PROCESS      949441772
	zchen    ttys ttys6         23234    7 USER_PROCESS      949441772
		 ttys ttys6         21395    8 DEAD_PROCESS      949441781
	</pre>
	<p>
	Here, we see zchen at ttys5 twice with the same process id and
	the same time.  What is going on?
	<p>
	It turns out that when a user connects to a machine using
	ssh (the secure shell encrypted connection program) two
	entries appear.  On the other hand, when a user connects using
	telnet, only one entry appears.  You can try this yourself.
	<p>
	I do not have the code in front of me, but I suspect that the
	ssh server that accepts the connection adds an entry to wtmp
	when it starts the login session.  Once it has established an
	encrypted connection, the ssh server calls login to handle
	the rest of the session startup.
	<p>
	Login, usually called from getty or telnetd, adds a record to
	the wtmp file.  
	<p>
	The process id is the same because the ssh server starts a process
	for the session, arranges for the communication channel to
	be encrypted, then calls exec(2) to run the login program
	in that encrypted environment.
	<p>

<dt><b>People Still Logged In</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>
	Consider the following situation:  
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	User fred logs in at 2pm on Monday.<br>
	A wtmp entry for fred at 2pm on monday is created.<br>
	You type <tt>ac fred</tt> at 3pm on Monday<br>
	How much login time does ac report?
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	The traditional ac solution is to scan through the file and
	see that fred logged in at 2pm and has no matching logout entry.
	Since the current time is 3pm, fred is charged 1 hour for this
	session.
	<p>
	Makes sense?  Many people think so.  In fact, the version of ac
	on the system uses that model.
	<p>
	<b>BUT NOT ALWAYS</b>
	<P>
	If you type <tt>ac -f /var/adm/wtmp fred</tt> at 3pm on Monday,
	you may well get less than one hour of time.
	<p>
	Here's why.
	<p>
	The version of ac on the system here behaves differently when given
	the <tt>-f</tt> option than it does when it uses the `default file',
	even if they are the same.
	<p>
	Here's what it does.  If a filename is given, it takes the last
	login entry in the file as the `end of time.'  Therefore, if fred
	logged in at 2pm in that wtmp file, and the last login recorded in
	that file was as 2:30pm, then fred would only be charged for 30
	minutes.
	<p>
	There are some good reasons for that.  See if you can think of
	them.
	<p>
	</dd>
<dt><B>Handling REBOOTS</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>
	The way this version of ac handles reboot entries is a bit odd.
	If fred logs in at 2pm and the wtmp file shows a reboot at 3pm,
	you might think that fred would be charged for 1 hour.  That
	does not seem to be the case.  
	<p>
	Examine the data used for the reboot test to see what this program
	really does.
	<p>
	</dd>
<dt><B>What about those <font size=-1>LOGIN</font> records I don't see?</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>
	Some systems have terminals connected to the computer.  If you run Unix at
	home, you probably see a login: prompt on your screen.  Most PC unix versions
	allow multiple screens, each with its own login: prompt.
	<p>
	When you sit down at the computer, you enter your logname and password to
	that login: prompt and then are logged in.
	<p>
	When you logout, the system issues a new login: prompt on the screen and
	sits there.
	<p>
	It is those login: prompt screens that correspond to <font size=-1>LOGIN</font>
	entries in wtmp.
	<p>
	On the other hand, when you telnet into a machine, or click on a terminal
	button on the workstations at the science center, a new shell is started
	up <i>just like that</i> with no login screen at all.
	<p>
	Therefore, the wtmp file at the science center lacks the <font size=-1>LOGIN</font>
	entries.  If you are running this on a home linux machine, you are likely to
	see those entries.
